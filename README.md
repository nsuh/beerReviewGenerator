Faking beer snobbery using N-Grams and markov chains!
Try it yourself by running cleanBeerReviews.py, and then generateReview.py!

Inspiration and much of the code from http://www.onthelambda.com/2014/02/20/how-to-fake-a-sophisticated-knowledge-of-wine-with-markov-chains/


Some successes:

"Light Amber color, nearly copper, medium head. Medium hopped, with some yeast haze when finishing bottle.”

“Ton of malt and sweet malts, maybe a touch of caramel. Texture is fairly bitter with a nice head. nice fruity aroma. Nicely carbonated, with a thick, camel color fine bubbled head.”

"Pours a clear coppery orange with off-white foam disapearing quickly. Lots of really nice beer that finished with a moderate amount of carbonation. Not too complex, but easy to drink, but not very dark brown with good clarity and small bubbles.”

Some fails:

“Did a Schneider tasting over the aroma of English marmalade, over-riped banana and clove dominate the aroma.”

"Not a fan - a symbol of outstanding quality and taste that's been perfected by the brewers could cram into our mash tun, and lots of lace.”

“The beer poured a huge loyal following and has a distinct fruity banana aroma. It smells more chocolate than it was, but a must when in Antwerp - although very touristic, also quality.”



This was a really fun project!  Another interesting application would be to generate 1-star Yelp reviews.  Next time - faking disgruntledness.
